      <description>Custom cybersecurity solution validation Validation services tailored to what enterprises want to highlight and focus on. Unlike other testing/ research / analyst firms, our evaluations are built on data gathered hands-on in a lab. Our Validation metrics can be either be based out of a single product/solution or competitive; evaluating a single product or solution or offering, or multiple offerings spread across several competitors.
SecureIQLab engineers and analysts work with enterprises and security vendors to develop a test plan specific to their business requirements and use-cases, then carry out the evaluation either in our lab facility in Austin, TX or our partner lab site, or any combination thereof.</description>
